# lingua

Language is a very strange tool. I have heard that many friends consider Rust a difficult programming language. I have finally realized that I love researching rather than putting theory into practice. For the sake of survival, acquiring these skills is inevitable. Language is used differently in different environments, and every creator develops methods according to their own design style. Every difficulty has its own cause and origin. Look at the differences, understand the underlying reasonsâ€”and that is enough for now.

This repo is just for exercise, not for projects. When my energy cannot create any coding ideas, I would write some codes automatically.
